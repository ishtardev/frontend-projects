## Website Preview (rick roll edition)
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/image.png" width="300" alt="Website preview"/>
</p>

#### When hovered

<p align="center"> 
  <img src="images/image2.png" width="300" alt="Website preview"/>
</p>

## Notes : 
- to make only the gift clickable and not the whole website (cause that's the issue i was having) is to add ``cursor: pointer;``, ``display: inline-block;``,    ``text-decoration: none;`` to the `gift-img` class. 

- the second issue was when you hover the gift to open you can see the borders and the problem was in the image lol
