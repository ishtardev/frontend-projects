## Website Preview

## Notes : 
- to make only the gift clickable and not the whole site cause that's the issue i was having is to add ``cursor: pointer;``, ``display: inline-block;``,    ``text-decoration: none;`` to the `gift-img` class. 

- the second issue was when you hover the gift to open it you can see the borders and the problem was in the image
